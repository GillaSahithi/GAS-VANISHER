Now a days we are seeing that many fire accidents are taking place in households. This results in 
the threat to human lives, property and sometimes lead to loss of lives. Most fire accidents are 
caused because of poor-quality rubber tube or the regulator is not turned off when not in use. Due 
to busy life’s, people are neglecting the safety precautions in the household. The Liquid Petroleum 
Gas (LPG) is highly inflammable, it is the source for fire accident. Even people are not able to 
detect the gas released in small quantity and that leading to the major accident. This problem can 
be solved with the help of technology. The main aim of the model is to minimize the risk of fire 
accident by taking precautions when there is a detection. Our model presents a Gas Leakage Alert 
System to detect Gas leakage and to alert people with the buzzer in house and to send message to 
the user regarding gas leakage through GSM module. If the user isn’t nearby the house and want 
to take precautions for not causing any accidents this model will be very useful. The gas leaked is 
sent out of the house with the help of the exhauster fan when the gas is leaked. So in this way 
precautions are taken and we are reducing maximum risk factor of fire accidents due to gas 
leakage. Hence this helps the people to find the Gas Leakage and can protect themselves and 
property by taking the precautions instantly.
